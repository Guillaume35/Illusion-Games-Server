REQUIREMENTS

   This program is developed under Ubuntu 11.04 and Ubuntu 11.10.
   It is also maintained on Debian 6.
   Others Linux distributions must be compatible but are not maintained.

   Actually required packages :
          - Python3.2

   Package that will be required in the final version :
          - PostgreSQL >= 8.4
          - py-postgresql >= 1.0.2
            (http://python.projects.postgresql.org/)
            archive available in lib/py-postgresql-1.0.2.tar.gz

   You also need IGS-term installed on a client computer or directly 
   on the server (https://github.com/Guillaume35/IGS-Terminal).


TEST THE PROGRAM

   Actually, the program is not in a testing phase.


DEVELOP THE PROGRAM

   Program sources are contained in the sources/ directory. You can be
   involved in igs development in many ways :
          - Create new functions
          - Correct language, syntax and expression
   
   * Notes about developping IGS :
   
   - IGS is based on a dynamic path system for configuration file. If 
   you want to open() a file in a script, use the folowing tool :
   
   	import path
   	f = open(path.get('config'), 'r')
   
   - If you create a new file in the program structure (config file or 
   script), you have to add it on paths/linux and paths/opt files.
   These files are used create non-dynamic path during the build.


CREATE PACKAGE

   Use build.conf to configure how the program will be build, and how
   it will be installed on the computer.
   
   If you want a debian package, you can edit package information in
   file build-tools/debian/control
   
   Make sure the folowing program are executable :
          - build
          - build-tools/create_tar
          - build-tools/debian/create_md5
          - build-tools/debian/install
          - build-tools/debian/make-deb
   
   Run build (execute it in a terminal) :
          cd /path/to/igs
          ./build
   Or :
          cd /path/to/igs
          python3 build.py
